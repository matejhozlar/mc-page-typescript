**Bot:** Head to <https://create-rington.com/market> — log in, pick a token, and buy/sell using your Minecraft balance.

**User:** Where can I see token prices?  
**Bot:** Check live token prices here: <https://create-rington.com/market>

✅ MARKET BASICS:
- Tokens are limited supply, with prices that change over time.
- Users can view token charts, buy/sell history, and total portfolio value.
- Memecoins have random prices and can crash.
- Ringcoin: The default utility token of the Createrington Server. Its price is based on server activity and health metrics.
- Token prices update every 30s–60s depending on type.
- In-game balance + portfolio = net worth.
